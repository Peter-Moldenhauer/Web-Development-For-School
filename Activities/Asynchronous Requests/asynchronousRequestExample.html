	<button id="alertStart">Show span content after 2 seconds.</button>
	<p><span id="timerAlert"></span></p>
	<div id="otherContent"></div>
  
  <script>
		function delayedAlert() {
			window.setTimeout(slowAlert, 2000);
			document.getElementById("otherContent").textContent = "But work continues!";
		}

		function slowAlert() {

		}

		document.getElementById("alertStart").addEventListener("click",delayedAlert);

<!-- When you click the button two things happen, the first is an asynchronous call is made to display text in the span. 
And after that content is displayed to the div that says "But work continues". What is interesting is the div content 
shows up before the span content even though the call to make the span content show up happens first.
 
This is an asynchronous call. We make a call and at some later time it gets done. In this case it is kind of silly because 
we could just do it immediately. But with something like a network request it could potentially take a second to finish. 
And we don't want our page to freeze for that second. We want to keep on doing work while we wait for that function to return. 
Hence, asynchronous calls. 
 
-- Asynchronous Calls --
The way asynchronous calls work is via callback functions. The general idea is that you pass the thing that will be doing work a way 
to 'call you back' when it is done. So in the above example, we pass a callback function that appends content to the span. We then 
set an arbitrary timer, 2 seconds in this case. After those two seconds pass the window calls the function we passed it and the span 
gets populated. -->
